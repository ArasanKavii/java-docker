### Docker & Java

This repo contains demo materials for:
+ Tips minimize java containers images
+ Tricks for fast startup java apps running in containrs
+ gotchas and issues while running java apps in containers and the improvements that has been made

The repo is splitte into multiple branchs, each contains a specific topic. The `Dockerfile`s uses the generated jar after running the build (`mvn clean package`). The build step could be integrated in the provided `Dockerfile`s, but it would slow the demoing the intetntion of this repo, so I kept it outside. Below branch details:
+ `master`: simple netty app, running in a container
+ `cdc`: This showcase the class data sharing (CDS) feature. CDC offers dynamic sharing of data between multiple Java Virtual Machines (JVM), which helps to reduce the startup time and memory footprint.
+ `aot`: Using Ahead Of Time compilation. It compiles the bytecode such that it is completely static which should lead to the fastest startup and initial execution speed.
+ `graal`: This part uses graal VM to create native images for existing JVM-based applications. 
+ `sb`: This branch contains a simple instructions to run the [petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) application and test how it behaves running inside a java 8 docker container, and java 11!
