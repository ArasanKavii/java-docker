### Docker & Java

This repo contains demo materials for:
+ Tips minimize java containers images
+ Tricks for fast startup java apps running in containrs
+ gotchas and issues while running java apps in containers and the improvements that has been made

The repo is splitte into multiple branchs, each contains a specific topic. The `Dockerfile`s uses the generated jar after running the build (`mvn clean package`). The build step could be integrated in the provided `Dockerfile`s, but it would slow the demoing the intetntion of this repo, so I kept it outside. Below branch details:
+ `master`: simple netty app, running in a container
+ `mod`: Using Project Jigsawâ€™s `jlink`, that offers the ability to produce a minimal JRE based on the modules our application requires.
+ `alpine`: This uses the early access alpine build of java 13, based on project protola: the community effort to port java to `musl`
+ `cdc`: This showcase the class data sharing (CDS) feature. CDC offers dynamic sharing of data between multiple Java Virtual Machines (JVM), which helps to reduce the startup time and memory footprint.
+ `aot`: Using Ahead Of Time compilation. It compiles the bytecode such that it is completely static which should lead to the fastest startup and initial execution speed.
+ `graal`: This part uses graal VM to create native images for existing JVM-based applications. 
+ `sb`: This branch contains a simple instructions to run the [petclinic](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic) application and test how it behaves running inside a java 8 docker container, and java 11!

### Benchmarking
the `bench.sh` run each container and print at the end the total size of the image + the time it takes for teh container to run! for me I named the images: `plain`, `cdc`,`aot`,`graal` and `mod`. I prefixed each of them with `dc`! Executing the scripts shows below results in my machine:

```
Image   size        Startup
aot     463.864MB   654 ms
cdc     443.183MB   689 ms
plain   425.875MB   740 ms
mod     55.6048MB   686 ms
graal   9.49464MB   78 ms
